# pizza-commander


A simple web app to order pizza for large groups.

## Objectives

 * Parse the [Domino's pizza menu page](http://www.dominos.fr/carte_pizzas.php) and get the list of the pizzas and the component to initialize the database.
 * While we are at parsing pizzas, what about getting the picture too?
 * Display the pizzas in a simple webpage where you can order half pizzas.
 * Send the order, and the server calculates the exact order (regrouping half parts in whole pizzas).
 * The server displays on the webpage the order, you now just have to call Domino's :)
 * Get the BDE guy pay for you, and get him bringing back the pizzas. [#cleverBoy](http://www.standard.co.uk/incoming/article7799775.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/einstein2.jpg)

We can improve these simple specifications by:

 * automatical order,
 * when you order, you can enter the name of the person ordering to have on the final order 'who order what'.
